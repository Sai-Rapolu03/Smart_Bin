 In the present day scenario, many times we see that the garbage bins or Dust bins placed at public places in the cities are overflowing due to increase in the waste every day. It creates an unhygienic condition for the people and creates a bad smell around the surroundings that leads to the spread of some deadly diseases & human illness.
This Smart dust bin alerts the municipal workers through a notification when the dustbin is full. This feature helps the workers to empty the dustbin before it is overfilled. Workers can locate the dustbin easily as the location of it is also sent to the worker.
Our Smart Dustbin also automatically segregates Wet Waste, Dry Waste, E-Waste and Recyclable material. This feature will help Municipalities cut down on costs spent on Waste Segregation.
